# Tower of Words

A web application that introduces gamified spelling activities, was initially proposed for development in courses CSIT321 - Applications Development and Emerging Technologies, ES038 â€“ Technopreneurship, and CSIT340 - Industry Elective 1. It is now undergoing an upgrade, adapting integration with the Merriam API to enhance efficiency and dataset accuracy. Positioned as a tool for elementary teachers, especially those working with grade 3 students, it aims to enrich literacy skills in an engaging way.
